This zip file contains a material library for the 3ds Max 2014 & 2015 Iray+ plugins.

INSTALLING

1. Extract the contents of the zip file to a location of your choice.

      This will extract 1 material library (.mat) file and any textures required by its materials.

      For example, extracting a zip file called "Library1.zip" to a directory called "C:\Libraries"
	  will add these files:

      C:\Libraries\Library1.mat
      C:\Libraries\Iray+ Textures\Library1\Texture1.png
      C:\Libraries\Iray+ Textures\Library1\Texture2.png
      ...

      This directory structure conveniently lets you store multiple Iray+ material libraries
	  alongside each other.

      For example, extracting a 2nd zip file called "Library2.zip" to the same directory will
	  result in these files:

      C:\Libraries\Library1.mat
      C:\Libraries\Library2.mat
      C:\Libraries\Iray+ Textures\Library1\Texture1.png
      C:\Libraries\Iray+ Textures\Library1\Texture2.png
      C:\Libraries\Iray+ Textures\Library2\Texture1.png
      C:\Libraries\Iray+ Textures\Library2\Texture2.png
      ...

      (If you choose this structure, then you may be prompted to merge the "Iray+ Textures" folder
	  in the zip file with the folder on disk. Choose "Yes".)

      You may alternatively choose any structure that you like.

2. Launch 3ds Max, and click on the Customize->Configure User Paths... menu.

3. Select the External Files tab and click Add...

4. Select the folder that contains the .mat file (e.g. "C:\Libraries") and tick "Add Subpaths".

5. Open the Slate Material Editor and from the top left arrow, Open Material Library...

6. Select the .mat file on your disk.
